<h3 align="center">Conex Solutions Storage Container Website</h3>

  <p align="center">
    A project in development for my brother's small business, selling and renting storage containers.

  </p>
<p align="center">*****</p>

<p>Project is complete through the MVP stage, with most of the features planned in the wireframe. I decided not to build the "Location" component yet, as all of his containers are currently only at one location. Also, some of the frontend design was changed from the original wireframe in order to improve navigation and information display.</p>
<p>The email function, when a user is logged in and submits an inquiry from the inventory page, has been tested and is working. However, I did not include my real Gmail app password or my brother's real email address in the code (inventory.html) since this repository is public.</p>
<p>I will not have the time before this stack ends to deploy the site on AWS, but I intend to keep working on it and add some additional functionality that my brother needs before deployment.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
