<h3 align="center">Conex Solutions Storage Container Website</h3>

  <p align="center">
    A project in development for my brother's small business, selling and renting storage containers.

  </p>
<p align="center">*****</p>

<p>Project is complete through the MVP stage, with most of the features planned in the wireframe.</p>
<p>The email function, when a user is logged in and submits an inquiry from the inventory page, has been tested and is working. However, I did not include my real Gmail app password or my brother's real email address in the code (inventory.html) since this repository is public.</p>
<p>I will not have the time before this stack ends to deploy the site on AWS, but I intend to keep working on it and add some additional functionality that my brother needs before deployment.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
